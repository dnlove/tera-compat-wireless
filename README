+ This is throughput Enabled Rate Adaptation (TERA), a new approach to rate adaptation that accounts for interference and congestion effects implicitly but is based solely on measurements of the throughput attained at different data rates. 

A much improved and better version of MAICA

+ You can find the implementation in 

net/mac80211/rc80211_tera.{h,c}

+ I made modifications to the following files

config.mk
net/mac80211/Makefile
net/mac80211/rate.h
net/mac80211/main.c
net/mac80211/rc80211_tera_debug_fs.c
